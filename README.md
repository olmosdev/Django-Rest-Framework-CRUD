# REST API

This is a simple example of a small API REST FULL built with Python, Django and Django REST Framework. The idea and concept is not mine. 
This is another project based on [Fazt](https://youtu.be/GE0Q8YNKNgs), a great YouTube Channel related to programming.

*Note: Virtualenv was used as virtual enviroment*
